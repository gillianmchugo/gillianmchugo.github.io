Leveraging imputed genome-wide SNP data, we characterise thousands of *cis*-expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) and show that the PB transcriptome is substantially impacted by intrapopulation genomic variation during *M. bovis* infection. Integrating our *cis*-eQTL data with bTB susceptibility GWAS summary statistics, we perform a transcriptome-wide association study and identify 115 functionally relevant genes (including *RGS10*, *GBP4*, *TREML2*, and *RELT*) and provide important new omics data for understanding the host response to mycobacterial infections that cause tuberculosis in mammals.","tags":[],"title":"Integrative genomics sheds light on the immunogenetics of tuberculosis in cattle","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Gillian P.

These are transmitted by infected tsetse flies (*Glossina* spp.) and cause a similar disease in animals, known as African animal trypanosomiasis (AAT). AAT is one of the largest constraints to livestock production in sub-Saharan Africa and causes a financial burden of approximately $4.5 billion annually. Some African *Bos taurus* cattle populations have an important evolutionary adaptation known as trypanotolerance, a genetically determined tolerance of infection by trypanosome parasites (*Trypanosoma* spp.). Trypanotolerant African *B. taurus* N’Dama and trypanosusceptible *Bos indicus* Boran cattle responded in largely similar ways during trypanosome infection when gene expression was examined using blood, liver, lymph node, and spleen samples with peaks and troughs of gene expression differences following the cyclic pattern of parasitaemia exhibited during trypanosome infection. However, differences in response to infection between the two breeds were reflected in differential expression of genes related to the immune system such as those encoding antimicrobial peptides and cytokines, including, for example, the antimicrobial peptide encoding genes *LEAP2*, *CATHL3*, *DEFB4A*, and *S100A7* and the cytokine genes *CCL20*, *CXCL11*, *CXCL13*, *CXCL16*, *CXCL17*, *IL33*, and *TNFSF13B*. In addition, transcriptional profiling of peripheral blood identified expression differences in genes relating to coagulation and iron homeostasis, which supports the hypothesis that the dual control of parasitaemia and the anaemia resulting from the innate immune response to trypanosome parasites is key to trypanotolerance and provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying this phenomenon.","tags":[],"title":"Functional genomics of trypanotolerant and trypanosusceptible cattle infected with 𝘛𝘳𝘺𝘱𝘢𝘯𝘰𝘴𝘰𝘮𝘢 𝘤𝘰𝘯𝘨𝘰𝘭𝘦𝘯𝘴𝘦 across multiple time points and tissues","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Gillian P.

Previous studies have shown that the pathogenesis of bTB disease is comparable to hTB disease, and that the bovine and human alveolar macrophage (bAM and hAM, respectively) transcriptomes are extensively reprogrammed in response to infection with these intracellular mycobacterial pathogens. In this study, a multi-omics integrative approach was applied with functional genomics and GWAS data sets across the two primary hosts (*Bos taurus* and *Homo sapiens*) and both pathogens (*M. bovis* and *M. tuberculosis*). Four different experimental infection groups were used: 1) bAM infected with *M. bovis*, 2) bAM infected with *M. tuberculosis*, 3) hAM infected with *M. tuberculosis*, and 4) human monocyte-derived macrophages (hMDM) infected with *M. tuberculosis*. RNA-seq data from these experiments 24 h post-infection (24 hpi) was analysed using three computational pipelines: 1) differentially expressed genes, 2) differential gene expression interaction networks, and 3) combined pathway analysis. The results were integrated with high-resolution bovine and human GWAS data sets to detect novel quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for resistance to mycobacterial infection and resilience to disease. This revealed common and unique response macrophage pathways for both pathogens and identified 32 genes (12 bovine and 20 human) significantly enriched for SNPs associated with disease resistance, the majority of which encode key components of the NF-κB signalling pathway and that also drive formation of the granuloma.","tags":[],"title":"Integrative and comparative genomic analyses of mammalian macrophage responses to intracellular mycobacterial pathogens","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Pamela A.

Research suggests that T-cell exhaustion, increased immunosuppressive cytokines, induction of regulatory T cells and increased expression of immune checkpoint inhibitors may contribute to its pathogenesis. This study aimed to gain a deeper understanding of the molecular changes occurring in canine demodicosis using mass spectrometry and pathway enrichment analysis. The results indicate that endoplasmic reticulum stress promotes canine demodicosis through regulation of three linked signalling pathways: *eIF2*, *mTOR*, and *eIF4* and *p70S6K*. These pathways are involved in the modulation of Toll-like receptors, most notably *TLR2*, and have been shown to play a role in the pathogenesis of skin diseases in both dogs and humans. Moreover, these pathways are also implicated in the promotion of immunosuppressive M2 phenotype macrophages. Immunohistochemical analysis, utilising common markers of dendritic cells and macrophages, verified the presence of M2 macrophages in canine demodicosis. The proteomic analysis also identified immunological disease, organismal injury and abnormalities and inflammatory response as the most significant underlying diseases and disorders associated with canine demodicosis. This study demonstrates that *Demodex* mites, through ER stress, unfolded protein response and M2 macrophages contribute to an immunosuppressive microenvironment, thereby assisting in their proliferation.","tags":[],"title":"Unveiling the role of endoplasmic reticulum stress pathways in canine demodicosis","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Mohammed A.

To clarify these changes before and after oestrus, RNA-seq was used to profile the transcriptome of oestrus-synchronized beef heifers. Endometrial samples were collected from 29 animals, which were slaughtered in six groups beginning 12 h after the withdrawal of intravaginal progesterone releasing devices until seven days post-oestrus onset (luteal phase). The groups represented proestrus, early oestrus, metoestrus and early dioestrus (luteal phase). Changes in gene expression were estimated relative to gene expression at oestrus. Ingenuity® Pathway Analysis (IPA®) was used to identify canonical pathways and functional processes of biological importance. A total of 5,845 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified. The lowest number of DEGs was observed at the 12 h post-oestrus time point, whereas the greatest number was observed at Day 7 post-oestrus onset (luteal phase). A total of 2,748 DEGs at this time point did not overlap with any other time points.

To clarify these changes before and after oestrus, RNA-seq was used to profile the transcriptome of oestrus-synchronized beef heifers. Endometrial samples were collected from 29 animals, which were slaughtered in six groups beginning 12 h after the withdrawal of intravaginal progesterone releasing devices until seven days post-oestrus onset (luteal phase). The groups represented proestrus, early oestrus, metoestrus and early dioestrus (luteal phase). Changes in gene expression were estimated relative to gene expression at oestrus. Ingenuity® Pathway Analysis (IPA®) was used to identify canonical pathways and functional processes of biological importance. A total of 5,845 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified. The lowest number of DEGs was observed at the 12 h post-oestrus time point, whereas the greatest number was observed at Day 7 post-oestrus onset (luteal phase). A total of 2,748 DEGs at this time point did not overlap with any other time points. Prior to oestrus, Neurological disease and Organismal injury and abnormalities appeared among the top IPA® diseases and functions categories, with upregulation of genes involved in neurogenesis. Lipid metabolism was upregulated before oestrus and downregulated at 48h post-oestrus, at which point an upregulation of immune-related pathways was observed.

Criollo cattle exhibit distinct characteristics such as a resistance to disease and exceptional heat tolerance. In addition to European taurine (*Bos taurus*) ancestry, it has been proposed that Criollo cattle have experienced gene flow from African taurine and Asian zebu (*Bos indicus*) populations. In this study we analysed three Criollo breeds (Blanco Orejinegro and Hartón del Valle from Colombia , and Limonero from Venezuela) using whole genome sequencing data to examine population structure and admixture at very high resolution. We also examined selection signatures associated with a myriad of adaptive traits, revealing genes linked to thermotolerance, reproduction, fertility, and immunity. Our results also provided evidence of artificial selection, particularly for distinct coat and skin coloration traits. We did not detect evidence for historical African taurine admixture in Criollo cattle; however, there was evidence of uniform admixture between the Hartón del Valle breed and zebu cattle. This study underscores the remarkable adaptability of Criollo cattle, driven by both natural and human-mediated selection. It highlights the genetic richness and potential of these breeds in the face of climate change, habitat flux, and disease challenges.

Consequently, these breeds have evolved distinct characteristics such as resistance to disease and exceptional heat tolerance. In addition to European taurine (*Bos taurus*) ancestry, it has been proposed that gene flow from African taurine and Asian zebu (*Bos indicus*) cattle has shaped the ancestry of Criollo cattle. In this study, we analysed Criollo breeds from Colombia and Venezuela using whole genome sequencing data to examine population structure and admixture at very high resolution. We did not detect evidence of African taurine admixture in Criollo cattle; however, there was evidence of longstanding zebu ancestry in one breed (Hartón del Valle). In addition, we detected selection signatures associated with a myriad of adaptive traits, revealing genes linked to thermotolerance, reproduction, fertility, immunity, and distinct coat and skin coloration traits. This study underscores the remarkable adaptability of Criollo cattle and highlights the genetic richness and potential of these breeds in the face of climate change, habitat flux, and disease challenges.

Research suggests that T cell exhaustion, increased immunosuppressive cytokines, induction of regulatory T cells, and increased expression of immune checkpoint inhibitors may contribute to its pathogenesis. This study aimed to gain a deeper understanding of the molecular changes occurring in canine demodicosis using mass spectrometry and pathway enrichment analysis. The results indicate that endoplasmic reticulum stress is promoting canine demodicosis through regulation of three linked signalling pathways: eIF2, mTOR, and eIF4 and p70S6K. These pathways are involved in the modulation of Toll-like receptors, most notably TLR2, and have been shown to play a role in the pathogenesis of skin diseases in both dogs and humans. Moreover, these pathways are also implicated in the promotion of immunosuppressive M2 phenotype macrophages. Immunohistochemical analysis, utilizing common markers of dendritic cells and macrophages, verified the presence of M2 macrophages in canine demodicosis. The proteomic analysis also identified immunological disease, organismal injury and abnormalities, and inflammatory response as the most significant underlying diseases and disorders associated with canine demodicosis. This study demonstrates that *Demodex* mites, through ER stress, unfolded protein response and M2 macrophages contribute to an immunosuppressive microenvironment thereby assisting in their proliferation.","tags":[],"title":"Unveiling the role of endoplasmic reticulum stress pathways in canine demodicosis","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sajad A.

Previous studies have shown that the pathogenesis of bTB disease is comparable to hTB disease, and that the bovine and human alveolar macrophage (bAM and hAM, respectively) transcriptomes are extensively reprogrammed in response to infection with these intracellular mycobacterial pathogens. However, although *M. bovis* and *M. tuberculosis* share over 99% identity at the genome level, the innate immune responses to these pathogens have been shown to be different in human or cattle hosts.\nIn this study, a multi-omics integrative approach was applied to encompass functional genomics and GWAS data sets across the two primary hosts (*Bos taurus* and *Homo sapiens*) and both pathogens (*M. bovis* and *M. tuberculosis*). Four different experimental infection groups were used, each with parallel non-infected control cells: 1) bAM infected with *M. bovis*, 2) bAM infected with *M. tuberculosis*, 3) hAM infected with *M. tuberculosis*, and 4) human monocyte-derived macrophages (hMDM) infected with *M. tuberculosis*. RNA-seq data from these experiments 24 hours post-infection (24 hpi) was analysed using three separate computational pipelines: 1) differentially expressed genes, 2) differential gene expression interaction networks, and 3) combined pathway analysis. The results of these analyses were then integrated with high-resolution bovine and human GWAS data sets to detect novel quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for resistance to mycobacterial infection and resilience to disease.

An incomplete understanding of the host immune response contributes to the challenges of control and eradication of this zoonotic disease. In this study, high-throughput bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) was used to characterize differential gene expression in γδ T cells – a subgroup of T cells which bridge innate and adaptive immunity and have specific anti-mycobacterial response mechanisms. γδ T cell subsets are classified on the basis of expression of a pathogen-recognition receptor known as *Workshop Cluster 1* (WC1) and we hypothesised that bTB infection may alter the phenotype and function of specific γδ T cell subsets. Peripheral blood was collected from naturally *M. bovis*-infected (positive for single intradermal comparative tuberculin test (SICTT) and IFN-γ ELISA) and age- and sex-matched, non-infected control Holstein-Friesian cattle. γδ T subsets were isolated using fluorescence activated cell sorting (*n* = 10-12 per group) and high-quality RNA extracted from each purified lymphocyte subset (WC1.1+, WC1.2+, WC1- and γδ-) was used to generate transcriptomes using bulk RNA-seq (*n* = 6 per group, representing a total of 48 RNA-seq libraries). Relatively low numbers of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were observed between most cell subsets; however, 163 genes were significantly differentially expressed in the *M. bovis*-infected compared to control groups for the WC1.1+ γδ T cell compartment (Log2 FC ≥ 1.5 and FDR *P*adj. ≤ 0.1). The majority of these DEGs (146) were significantly increased in expression in cells from the bTB+ cattle and included genes encoding transcription factor (*TBX21* and *EOMES*), chemokine receptors (*CCR5* and *CCR7*), granzymes (*GZMA*, *GZMM* and *GZMH*) and multiple killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIR) indicating cytotoxic functions. Biological pathway overrepresentation analysis revealed enrichment of genes with multiple immune functions including cell activation, proliferation, chemotaxis and cytotoxicity of lymphocytes. In conclusion, WC1.1+ γδ T cells have been proposed as major regulatory cell subset in cattle, and we provide evidence for preferential differential activation of this specific subset in cattle naturally infected with *M. bovis*. Understanding the role of these critical immune cells during mycobacterial infection contributes to our understanding of host immunity to bTB and identifies multiple novel cytotoxic functions of WC1.1+ γδ T cells.","tags":[],"title":"Preferential differential gene expression in the WC1.1⁺ γδ T cell compartment in cattle naturally infected with 𝘔𝘺𝘤𝘰𝘣𝘢𝘤𝘵𝘦𝘳𝘪𝘶𝘮 𝘣𝘰𝘷𝘪𝘴","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Haige Han","Beatrice A.

The phenotypic diversity of African cattle reflects adaptation to a wide range of agroecological conditions and complex patterns of admixture between the humpless *Bos taurus* (taurine) and humped *Bos indicus* (zebu) subspecies, which share a common ancestor 150-500 thousand years ago. Human migration and trade from Asia have left a peak of zebu nuclear ancestry in East Africa and most cattle populations across the continent have a hybrid genetic composition. Notwithstanding this, all African cattle possess taurine mitochondrial haplotypes, even populations with significant zebu nuclear ancestry. In this regard, the efficient functioning of the mitochondrion relies on a network of biochemical interactions between the products of 37 mitochondrial genes and more than one thousand nuclear genes; therefore, admixed African cattle represent ideal populations for evaluating mitonuclear interactions and mismatch between the nuclear and mitochondrial genomes. Using high-density SNP array data from 18 different cattle populations, including ten African admixed breeds, we find strong evidence for mitonuclear coevolution in hybrid African cattle with significant retention of *Bos taurus* alleles at mitochondrially-targeted nuclear genes, particularly those genes with products that directly interact with mtDNA-encoded protein subunits in OXPHOS and ribosomal complexes, or that have functions in mtDNA replication. We also show that subspecific local ancestry varies substantially across the genomes of admixed populations, with a marked signal of taurine ancestry at the major histocompatibility (MHC) gene cluster, which likely reflects adaptation to infectious disease challenges facing African livestock. Our results demonstrate that African admixed cattle represent an excellent comparative model for studying the phenotypic consequences of mitonuclear mismatch and genomic introgression in humans and other large mammals.","tags":[],"title":"Genome-wide local ancestry and direct evidence for mitonuclear co-adaptation in African hybrid cattle populations (𝘉𝘰𝘴 𝘵𝘢𝘶𝘳𝘶𝘴/𝘪𝘯𝘥𝘪𝘤𝘶𝘴)","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Michael J.

The rise of multidrug resistant TB (MDR-TB) and extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB) is of particular concern. *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* (the primary cause of human TB) and *Mycobacterium bovis* (the primary cause of bovine TB) are remarkably similar at the genome sequence level. In the face of this, it is important to understand the molecular mechanisms underpinning host responses to infection with these pathogens. This will have implications for diagnosis, vaccinology, and treatment of human TB and for disease control and management of bovine TB.\nIn the present study, differentially expressed genes (DEGs) within active functional modules (subnetworks) were analysed1. These DEGs were identified using RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) of human and bovine alveolar macrophages (hAM and bAM) 24 hours post infection (hpi) with *M. tuberculosis* and *M. bovis*, respectively. Following this, Ingenuity® Pathway Analysis (IPA®) was used to systematically extract enriched molecular pathways involved in host responses to infection2.\nTable 1 shows an overview of some of the key findings in this study. The results were multifaceted and complex and encompassed many aspects of host-pathogen interactions, including pathogen recognition, cell signalling and downstream inflammatory processes. This study provides further evidence to help frame future research questions that will be vital to developing a complete understanding of host-pathogen interactions for pathogenic mycobacterial infections of humans and cattle.","tags":[],"title":"A functional and integrative genomics analysis of host response to disease caused by infection with 𝘔𝘺𝘤𝘰𝘣𝘢𝘤𝘵𝘦𝘳𝘪𝘶𝘮 𝘵𝘶𝘣𝘦𝘳𝘤𝘶𝘭𝘰𝘴𝘪𝘴 in humans and 𝘔𝘺𝘤𝘰𝘣𝘢𝘤𝘵𝘦𝘳𝘪𝘶𝘮 𝘣𝘰𝘷𝘪𝘴 in cattle","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Aude Remot","Florence Carreras","Anthony Coupé","Émilie Doz-Deblauwe","Maria L.

While Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) is restricted to humans, Mycobacterium bovis (Mb) is present in a large range of mammalian hosts. In cattle, bovine TB (bTB) is a noticeable disease responsible for important economic losses in developed countries and underestimated zoonosis in the developing world. Early interactions that take place between mycobacteria and the lung tissue early after aerosol infection govern the outcome of the disease. In cattle, these early steps remain poorly characterized. The precision-cut lung slice (PCLS) model preserves the structure and cell diversity of the lung. We developed this model in cattle in order to study the early lung response to mycobacterial infection. In situ imaging of PCLS infected with fluorescent Mb revealed bacilli in the alveolar compartment, in adjacent or inside alveolar macrophages, and in close contact with pneumocytes. We analyzed the global transcriptional lung inflammation signature following infection of PCLS with Mb and Mtb in two French beef breeds: Blonde d’Aquitaine and Charolaise. Whereas, lungs from the Blonde d’Aquitaine produced high levels of mediators of neutrophil and monocyte recruitment in response to infection, such signatures were not observed in the Charolaise in our study. In the Blonde d’Aquitaine lung, whereas the inflammatory response was highly induced by two Mb strains, AF2122 isolated from cattle in the UK and Mb3601 circulating in France, the response against two Mtb strains, H37Rv, the reference laboratory strain, and BTB1558, isolated from zebu in Ethiopia, was very low. Strikingly, the type I interferon pathway was only induced by Mb but not Mtb strains, indicating that this pathway may be involved in mycobacterial virulence and host tropism. Hence, the PCLS model in cattle is a valuable tool to deepen our understanding of early interactions between lung host cells and mycobacteria. It revealed striking differences between cattle breeds and mycobacterial strains. This model could help in deciphering biomarkers of resistance vs. susceptibility to bTB in cattle as such information is still critically needed for bovine genetic selection programs and would greatly help the global effort to eradicate bTB.\nAcknowledgments We thank the staff from the Abattoir du Perche Vendômois for valuable access to and assistance for bovine post-mortem sampling.

While *Mycobacterium* *tuberculosis* (Mtb) is restricted to humans, *Mycobacterium bovis* (Mb) is present in a large range of mammalian hosts. In cattle, bovine TB (bTB) is a noticeable disease responsible for important economic losses in developed countries and underestimated zoonosis in the developing world. Early interactions that take place between mycobacteria and the lung tissue early after aerosol infection govern the outcome of the disease. In cattle, these early steps remain poorly characterized. The precision-cut lung slice (PCLS) model preserves the structure and cell diversity of the lung. We developed this model in cattle in order to study the early lung response to mycobacterial infection. *In situ* imaging of PCLS infected with fluorescent Mb revealed bacilli in the alveolar compartment, in adjacent or inside alveolar macrophages, and in close contact with pneumocytes. We analyzed the global transcriptional lung inflammation signature following infection of PCLS with Mb and Mtb in two French beef breeds: Blonde d'Aquitaine and Charolaise. Whereas, lungs from the Blonde d'Aquitaine produced high levels of mediators of neutrophil and monocyte recruitment in response to infection, such signatures were not observed in the Charolaise in our study. In the Blonde d'Aquitaine lung, whereas the inflammatory response was highly induced by two Mb strains, AF2122 isolated from cattle in the UK and Mb3601 circulating in France, the response against two Mtb strains, H37Rv, the reference laboratory strain, and BTB1558, isolated from zebu in Ethiopia, was very low. Strikingly, the type I interferon pathway was only induced by Mb but not Mtb strains, indicating that this pathway may be involved in mycobacterial virulence and host tropism. Hence, the PCLS model in cattle is a valuable tool to deepen our understanding of early interactions between lung host cells and mycobacteria. It revealed striking differences between cattle breeds and mycobacterial strains. This model could help in deciphering biomarkers of resistance vs. susceptibility to bTB in cattle as such information is still critically needed for bovine genetic selection programs and would greatly help the global effort to eradicate bTB.","tags":[],"title":"Mycobacterial infection of precision-cut lung slices reveals type 1 interferon pathway is locally induced by 𝘔𝘺𝘤𝘰𝘣𝘢𝘤𝘵𝘦𝘳𝘪𝘶𝘮 𝘣𝘰𝘷𝘪𝘴 but not 𝘔. 𝘵𝘶𝘣𝘦𝘳𝘤𝘶𝘭𝘰𝘴𝘪𝘴 in a cattle breed","type":"acknowledgement"},{"authors":["Thomas J.

Both genetic drift and selection can lead to high rates at which inbreeding increases if a small number of individuals contribute largely to subsequent generations. Increases in the rate of inbreeding would have negative consequences such as reductions of genetic variability and increased risk of inbreeding depression that may affect specific genomic regions and that can compromise the success of both conservation and selection programs. Traditionally, the control of inbreeding has been tracked by managing the relationships between individuals using pedigree records. With the advent of new genotyping and high-throughput sequencing technologies, obtaining more precise information about the relationships between individuals is now possible. While single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) chips or genotyping-by-sequencing data contain only a subset of the polymorphic variants available in a species, whole genome sequencing data provide access to complete information on all the variants of an individual. As a consequence, the estimation of coefficients to measure genetic variability may be affected by the type of data used for their estimation.\nDuring the post-genomics era, a variety of methods to characterize the levels of genetic diversity from genomic information within and between populations have been developed. These are related to the estimation of the selection signature and population structure or coefficients to determine the increase in inbreeding such as effective population size. However, under this new genomic perspective, methods and concepts need to be revised. In parallel to the development of genomic tools, traditional and new strategies to control inbreeding to simultaneously target conservation of genetic diversity and genetic improvement need to be developed or accommodated to the new context. The availability of genomic information opens up possibilities to include genome wide marker information in prediction of total breeding values and to obtain higher genetic gains through genomic selection but controlling the increase of the rate of inbreeding is also necessary to ensure the viability of the programs.","tags":[],"title":"Genetic variability in conservation and selection programs in the post-genomics era","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Thomas J.

First, a differential expression analysis was carried out to determine the most significantly differentially expressed (DE) genes between conditions at each time point. Second, two networks were constructed at each time point using gene correlation patterns to determine changes in expression across conditions. Functional sub-modules within each correlation network were selected by statistical criteria for modularity. Third, a base gene interaction network of the mammalian host response to mycobacterial infection was generated using the GeneCards database and InnateDB. Differential gene expression data were superimposed on this base network to extract functional modules of interconnected DE genes.\n**Conclusions**\nBovine GWAS data was obtained from a published BTB susceptibility/resistance study. The results from the three parallel analyses were integrated with this data to determine which of the three approaches identified genes significantly enriched for SNPs associated with susceptibility/resistance to *M. bovis* infection. Results indicate distinct and significant overlap in SNP discovery, demonstrating that network-based integration of biologically relevant transcriptomics data can leverage substantial additional information from GWAS data sets.","tags":[],"title":"Integrative genomics of the mammalian alveolar macrophage response to intracellular mycobacteria","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Di Wang","Lei Liu","Serafino M.

Methods\nIn the current study, RNA-Seq was used to profile the transcriptomes of peripheral blood leukocytes sampled from S. aureus-infected mothers and their S. aureus-infected daughters, and also healthy non-infected mothers and their healthy daughters. Differential gene expression was evaluated as follows: 1) S. aureus-infected cows versus healthy non-infected cows (S vs. H, which include all the mothers and daughters), 2) S. aureus-infected mothers versus healthy non-infected mothers (SM vs. HM), and 3) S. aureus-infected daughters versus healthy non-infected daughters (SMD vs. HMD). Results\nAnalysis of all identified expressed genes in the four groups (SM, SMD, HM, and HMD) showed that EPOR, IL9, IFNL3, CCL26, IL26 were exclusively expressed in both the HM and HMD groups, and that they were significantly (P \u0026lt; 0.05) enriched for the cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction pathway. A total of 17, 13 and 10 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) (FDR Padj. \u0026lt; 0.1 and |FC| \u0026gt; 1.2) were detected in the three comparisons, respectively.

For the S vs. H comparison, DEGs detected included CCL20, IL13 and MMP3, which are associated with the IL-17 signaling pathway. In the SM vs. HM and SMD vs. HMD comparisons, five (BLA-DQB, C1R, C2, FCGR1A, and KRT10 and six (BLA-DQB, C3AR1, CFI, FCAR, FCGR3A, and LOC10498484) genes, respectively, were involved in the S. aureus infection pathway.

One important evolutionary adaptation in certain African taurine populations is a genetically determined tolerance to infection by trypanosome parasites (*Trypanosoma* spp.), which are transmitted by infected tsetse flies (*Glossina* spp.) and cause African animal trypanosomiasis (AAT) disease.\nThe annual financial burden of AAT is approximately $4.5 billion and AAT is one of the largest constraints to livestock rearing in the areas of sub-Saharan Africa with significant tsetse densities. The West African *B. taurus* N’Dama breed is trypanotolerant; they have the ability to control parasite loads and to limit disease pathology compared to trypanosusceptible zebu breeds. However, *B. indicus* or hybrid animals are generally larger, produce higher milk yields and are therefore favoured by many farmers. Using local ancestry analysis of genome-wide high-density SNP data, we have examined hybrid West African cattle populations to study subchromosomal admixture.
